### **Defense in Depth – 7 Layers of Security (AWS Context)**

- **Data Security**
    
    - Safeguarding sensitive information through encryption at rest and in transit.
        
    - Use versioning, MFA Delete, and backup policies to ensure data integrity and protect against accidental or malicious changes.
        
- **Application Security**
    
    - Implement secure coding practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.
        
    - Apply web application firewalls (e.g. AWS WAF) and regular patching to block threats.
        
- **Compute Security**
    
    - Harden EC2 instances and containers with security groups, patched AMIs, and vulnerability management tools like AWS Inspector.
        
    - Enforce the principle of least privilege with IAM roles for compute resources.
        
- **Network Security**
    
    - Use VPC, subnets, and network ACLs to segment and control traffic flow.
        
    - Apply encryption in transit (TLS/SSL), VPC flow logs, and GuardDuty for network monitoring and threat detection.
        
- **Perimeter Security**
    
    - Employ AWS Shield for DDoS protection and perimeter defense.
        
    - Restrict public endpoints and use managed perimeter devices.
        
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
    
    - The _new_ perimeter: strictly control “who can do what” with IAM policies, organizations, and multi-factor authentication.
        
    - Enforce a Zero Trust model—never trust, always verify, least privilege everywhere.
        
- **Physical Security**
    
    - AWS data centers are equipped with extensive physical safeguards (access, environmental, redundancy), part of AWS’s shared responsibility model.
    

### **CIA Triad** 

- **Confidentiality**
    
    - Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data (using encryption, IAM policies).
        
- **Integrity**
    
    - Ensure information is accurate and unaltered (checksums, versioning, digital signatures).
        
- **Availability**
    
    - Ensure resources and data are accessible when needed (backup strategies, DR, multi-AZ deployments).
        

### **Vulnerabilities**

- Weaknesses or holes (in design or implementation) that could be exploited.
    
- Regular assessment and remediation are required (e.g. Inspector for workload vulnerability scans, Security Hub for findings aggregation).
    

### **Encryption**

- **Definition**: Converts readable data into unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access.
    
- **Types in AWS**:
    
    - _In transit_: Protects data moving between clients and AWS or between AWS services (using TLS, SSL).
        
    - _At rest_: Protects stored data (using AES-256, RSA, SSE-S3/SSE-KMS/SSE-C).
        
- **Key Management**: Managed via AWS KMS for auditability, access control, and centralization. Otherwise, AWS SSE for AWS managed encryption or self-managed encryption keys.
    

### **Cyphers, Salt, and Hashing**

- **Cyphers**: Algorithms for encrypting/decrypting (e.g., AES, RSA).
    
- **Hashing**: Irreversible transformation producing a fixed-length output, used for verification/authentication, not storing actual data.
    
- **Salting**: Adding random data to hashes to prevent dictionary/rainbow table attacks.
    

### **Digital Signature and Signing**

- **Digital Signing**:
    
    - Uses private keys to sign data—confirms authenticity and non-repudiation.
        
    - Public keys verify the signatures—ensures integrity (data hasn’t been tampered with).

        - **SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption, Customer-Provided Keys):**
            
            - You supply and manage your encryption keys.
                
            - AWS encrypts/decrypts on your behalf, but never stores the key.
                
            - **Advantage:** You retain complete control, but key management is your responsibility.
                
        - **Client-Side Encryption:**
            
            - Data is encrypted before being uploaded; you manage keys, AWS never has access.
                
            - **Advantage:** Full end-to-end control; suitable for highly sensitive data.
                
    - **Amazon EBS:** Supports encryption for volumes with a single checkbox; integrates with KMS.
        
    - **Amazon RDS/Aurora/Redshift:** Offers encryption at rest with KMS integration for database storage.
        
- **Key Point:** **Encryption at rest is crucial for protecting stored data against theft, unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements**.
    

### **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**

- **Centralized key management** for generating, managing, rotating, and controlling cryptographic keys across AWS services.

    - _Example_: Services like Amazon S3, EC2, and RDS are covered by a wide range of compliance programs (including PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC, and ISO/IEC certifications), while some newer or niche services may not yet support all compliance frameworks.
        
- **Service documentation and the AWS Artifact portal** allow customers to validate which compliance standards (such as SOC, PCI, HIPAA, ISO/IEC, FedRAMP) apply to each AWS service.
    
- **Customer responsibility**: Customers must ensure that their use of a service aligns with their regulatory obligations, especially for workloads requiring specific security controls or audit requirements.
    
- **Service configuration impacts compliance**: The way you configure encryption, access controls, data residency, logging, and monitoring in a given service determines if your usage is compliant.
    
    - _Example_: Enabling encryption and proper IAM controls in S3 or EBS.
        
- **AWS Managed Services vs. Customer Managed Configuration**: Some compliance (such as HIPAA or PCI) is only attainable when using specific AWS features/services and customer-managed security controls.
    
---
## **Regional Availability and Regulatory Scope**

- **Compliance offerings vary by AWS Region**:
    
    - Not all AWS services are available in every region, and some regions (like AWS GovCloud US or AWS China) are specifically designed to meet regional compliance needs.
        
    - _Example_: AWS China operates in partnership with local providers and has additional regulatory requirements, such as a business license and Chinese data residency.
        
- **Geographic and regulatory requirements**: Some industries and governments require data storage, processing, and backup to remain within certain national or regional borders ("data residency" laws).
    
    - AWS enables customers to select regions to address data sovereignty (e.g., in the EU for GDPR, or in AWS GovCloud for US government workloads).
        
- **Specific compliance programs are region/industry oriented**:
    
    - AWS GovCloud (US) supports compliance with FedRAMP, ITAR, and other US government security standards.
        
    - Regions may have different supported compliance certifications—always verify in AWS Artifact or the AWS Compliance documentation.
        
- **Customer due diligence** requires confirming regional service compliance before deploying regulated workloads.
