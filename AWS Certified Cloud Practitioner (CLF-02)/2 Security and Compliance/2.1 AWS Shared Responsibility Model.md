![[Shared Responsibility Model.png]]

## **Definition**

The AWS **shared responsibility model** ==divides responsibility for security and compliance between AWS and the customer==. 

**AWS** manages and controls the security of the cloud infrastructure, including the physical facilities, hardware, host operating system, virtualization layer, and networking. 

The **customer** is responsible for security in the cloud: managing and securing the guest operating system, application software, updates, security patches, and configuring security groups/firewalls.

Responsibilities ==**vary depending on the AWS service used**==, the integration of that service into the customer’s IT environment, and relevant laws or regulations. This model differentiates:

- **Security “of” the Cloud**: AWS's responsibility for the underlying infrastructure.
    
- **Security “in” the Cloud**: The customer’s responsibility for everything configured and run on top of that infrastructure.
    

This approach offers flexibility, as customers have control over their applications and data, while AWS takes care of the foundational security aspects. The division of duties helps reduce customer operational burden while enabling customized deployments to fit business and compliance needs.

## **Customer Responsibilities under AWS Shared Responsibility Model** 

- **Manage guest operating systems** (including updates and security patches) for IaaS resources like Amazon EC2.
    
- **Install, configure, and manage application software** and utilities on AWS-managed resources.
    
- **Configure AWS-provided security features**, such as security groups (virtual firewalls) and network ACLs.
    
- **Manage customer data**, including:
    
    - Selection and use of encryption options.
        
    - Classification and protection of data/assets.
        
    - Data lifecycle and backup management.
        
- **Implement access control** using IAM roles, users, groups, and policies.
    
- **Configure service-specific security settings** relevant to each AWS service (e.g., S3 bucket policies, DynamoDB access controls).
    
- **Decide which AWS services to use** and how those services integrate with internal IT systems, which determines the scope of security/configuration responsibilities.
    
- **Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards** relevant to the deployed workloads.
    
- **Shared management, operation, and verification of IT controls**, using AWS documentation to perform controls evaluation and review.
    
- **Perform customer-specific auditing, monitoring, and reporting** using AWS tools (e.g., CloudTrail, Config).
    
- **Review AWS compliance documentation** (e.g., through AWS Artifact) to support control assessments and audits.
    

`[!!note: These responsibilities will vary depending on the chosen AWS service, integration model, and applicable regulatory environment. For abstracted services like Amazon S3, customers focus more on data, access controls, and configurations, while for IaaS services like EC2, they manage the full software stack above the virtualization layer.]`

### **AWS Responsibilities under AWS Shared Responsibility Model**


- **Physical security of data centers and facilities**, including access control and surveillance.
    
- **Management of the global infrastructure**, such as Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations, ensuring redundancy and availability.
    
- **Security of the host operating system and virtualization layer** for compute resources (EC2 hosts, managed database infrastructure, etc.).
    
- **Protection of the underlying hardware, software, and networking**, including patching and maintenance at the infrastructure level.
    
- **Implementation of physical and environmental safeguards**, such as power, HVAC, fire detection and suppression, and disaster recovery.
    
- **Continuous monitoring and protection of infrastructure** using layered controls, automation, and regular security validations.
    
- **Compliance with global industry standards and regulatory requirements** through certifications and third-party attestations (e.g., SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, FedRAMP).
    
- **Operation of foundational services** (compute, storage, networking) according to security best practices and aligned standards.
    
- **Management of foundational IT controls** associated with the AWS Cloud environments.
    

`[!!note: AWS focuses on securing everything that powers the cloud platform itself, so customers can build and operate securely on top of it.]`

## **Responsibilities Depending on Service**

### **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Physical security of data centers
    
- Network infrastructure and physical hardware maintenance
    
- Virtualization layer and host operating system (hypervisor) security, updates, and patching
    
- Underlying AWS global infrastructure
    

**Customer Responsibilities**

- Guest operating system (OS) installation, configuration, patching, and security
    
- Application software deployment, updates, and management
    
- Configuration of security groups and network ACLs (firewalls)
    
- Management of IAM users, roles, and permissions for access control
    
- Encrypting data at rest and in transit (if desired)
    
- Managing data (backup, classification, compliance)
    

 `[!!note: Customers have the broadest responsibilities on EC2 since they control the operating system and everything on top of it.]`

### **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Physical data center security and network infrastructure
    
- Underlying hardware, database software installation and patching
    
- Operating system and database engine management
    
- Automated backups and replication (for managed features)
    

**Customer Responsibilities**

- Database schema, tables, and data management
    
- Database user accounts and access control
    
- Managing database-level encryption (enabling encryption at rest and in transit as needed)
    
- Database configuration settings (parameters, options)
    
- IAM roles and access permissions to RDS resources
    

`[!!note: AWS manages and patches the database OS and engine, but customers handle data, schema, and access. Less operational responsibility vs. EC2.]`

### **AWS Lambda** 

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Physical data center, server, and network infrastructure
    
- OS and runtime environment for Lambda functions (provisioning, patching)
    
- Scaling, availability, and uptime of the Lambda platform
    

**Customer Responsibilities**

- IAM roles and permissions attached to functions
    
- Environment variables and secrets management
    
- Validating and securing function inputs and outputs
    
- Implementing encryption (if using data storage)
    

`[!!note: Customers only control code and configuration, as AWS manages the entire infrastructure and runtime environment. This is the least amount of customer responsibility among major compute services.]`

### **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Physical data center and storage hardware protection
    
- AWS S3 platform, infrastructure, and service-level availability

- Access management: S3 bucket and object permissions, bucket policies, IAM roles
    
- Enabling and managing data encryption at rest and in transit (S3 SSE, KMS, SSL)
    
- Versioning and lifecycle policies as required
    

`[!!note: Security shifts almost entirely to data and access management by the customer; AWS manages infrastructure and platform security.]`

## **Amazon DynamoDB**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- IAM policies and fine-grained access control
    
- Data encryption settings (at rest and optionally in transit)
    
- Backup and restore settings, if needed
    

`[!!note: Similar to S3; customer focuses on access control and data, with AWS handling the database’s infrastructure and operations.]`

### **Amazon ECS & EKS** 

#### **ECS on EC2**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Infrastructure, physical servers, and underlying virtualization
    
- ECS control plane for task orchestration
    

**Customer Responsibilities**

- EC2 instance management (OS patching, security)
    
- ECS task and container configurations, IAM roles, application code
    
- Networking and security group configurations for EC2 hosts
    

 `[!!note: ECS on EC2 is closer to traditional IaaS, so customers have significant operational control and responsibility.]`

#### **ECS/EKS on Fargate**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Physical, network, hardware, and host OS
    
- Container runtime and cluster orchestration platform
    

**Customer Responsibilities**

- Task/container definitions, access management, and IAM roles
    
- Application code and container images security
    
- Networking and traffic policies for tasks
    

`[!!note: AWS manages almost everything beneath the application container level; customers only own code and configuration.]`

### **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

**AWS Responsibilities**

- Underlying network infrastructure
    
- Core routing components, switch hardware
    

**Customer Responsibilities**

- Configuration of subnets, route tables, NACLs (network ACLs), security groups
    
- Internet gateway, VPN, and Direct Connect setup
    
- VPC flow logging and monitoring
    

`[!!note: Customers control VPC design and security while AWS secures the physical network.]`

### **General Notes on Service-Level Responsibilities**

- **As service abstraction increases** (moving from EC2 to Lambda or fully managed databases), AWS assumes more operational responsibility.
    
- **Customer’s primary focus shifts** from infrastructure and OS management to data, access, and permissions configuration.
    
- Shared responsibility always requires the **customer to fully understand their portion**, regardless of how much AWS automates beneath the surface.
