`[!!tip: My mnemonic for this is No-guess Variable Expenses in Global Data Centres for Agile Economies]`

The benefits are as below:

1. **Trade fixed expense for variable expense**
	  - Pay only for what you use instead of making large upfront investments in data centers and servers.

2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
	  - Cloud providers aggregate usage from many customers, enabling lower variable costs and better pricing than most organizations can achieve on their own.

 3. **Stop guessing capacity** (Elasticity)
	  - Instantly scale resources up or down as needed, eliminating the risk of over-provisioning (wasting money) or under-provisioning (limiting performance).

4. **Increase speed and agility**
	  - Provision new IT resources in minutes, dramatically reducing the time required to experiment, develop, and deploy new applications.

5. **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
	  - Focus on projects that differentiate your business, rather than on infrastructure management tasks like racking, stacking, and powering servers.

6. **Go global in minutes**
	  - Deploy applications in multiple regions worldwide with just a few clicks, providing lower latency and a better experience for customers everywhere.
