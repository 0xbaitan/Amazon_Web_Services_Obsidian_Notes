### **1.6.1 Definition of a Web Service**

A **web service** is software accessible over the internet that exposes functionality via an API using standardized data formats like **XML** or **JSON** for requests and responses. It enables communication between different systems regardless of platform or programming language by using common internet protocols (HTTP/HTTPS). Web services are typically **stateless** and platform-independent, allowing seamless integration and interoperability. Examples in AWS include **Amazon S3**, **Amazon SQS**, and **Amazon SWF**, all accessed via web service APIs.

**Key points:**

- Accessible over internet using standard protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).
    
- Uses XML or JSON for structured request/response.
    
- Enables cross-platform communication.
    
- Stateless interactions for scalability.
    
- Core to AWS service interactions and integrations.
