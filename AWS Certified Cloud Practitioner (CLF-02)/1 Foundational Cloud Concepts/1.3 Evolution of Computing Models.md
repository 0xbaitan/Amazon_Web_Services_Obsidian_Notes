## **1.3.1 Physical Servers (Bare Metal)**

- **Single Tenant:** One customer per server.
    
- **Upfront Capacity Guessing:** Must estimate and purchase hardware for peak demand.
    
- **Underutilization:** Resources often idle, leading to wasted spend.
    
- **Overpaying:** Pay for full server even if not fully used.
    
- **Vertical Scaling Difficult:** Upgrading means replacing hardware, often disruptive.
    
- **Replacement is Difficult:** Physical swaps are slow and costly.
    
- **OS Limitations:** Bound by the installed operating system.
    
- **Resource Sharing Conflicts:** Multiple apps may compete for resources, causing performance issues.
    
- **Security & Privacy:** Full control, but also full responsibility for securing the environment.

## **1.3.2 Virtual Machines (VMs)**

- **Multi-Tenant:** Multiple customers share the same physical host, isolated by hypervisor.
    
- **Fractional Payment:** Pay for a portion of the server (e.g., single VM).
    
- **Still Possible to Overpay:** Underutilized VMs still incur costs.
    
- **Guest OS Limitations:** Each VM has its own OS, which can impact efficiency.
    
- **Easier Scaling:** Can scale vertically (resize VM) or horizontally (add more VMs).
    
- **Faster Provisioning:** Deploy new VMs in minutes instead of days or weeks.

### **1.3.3 Containers**

- **Docker Daemon:** Manages container lifecycle.
    
- **Multiple Containers:** Run many containers on the same OS kernel, isolated from each other.
    
- **Cost Effective:** Share underlying OS, reducing overhead.
    
- **Better Utilization:** Higher density and efficiency than VMs.
    
- **Rapid Deployment:** Containers start quickly and are ideal for microservices.

### **1.3.4 Serverless Compute**

- **Function-as-a-Service:** Run code in response to events (e.g., AWS Lambda).
    
- **Cold Start:** Initial invocation may have a delay.
    
- **Runs Only When Needed:** No charges when code isn’t running.
    
- **Highly Scalable:** Automatically scales to match demand.
    
- **No Server Management:** Abstracts away infrastructure, focusing only on code and business logic.
