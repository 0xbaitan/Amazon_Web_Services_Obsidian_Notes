AWS, as part of Amazon’s broader Climate Pledge, has committed to ambitious sustainability goals, focusing on renewable energy, cloud efficiency, and water stewardship to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

## **1.9.1 Renewable Energy**

- **100% Renewable Energy Goal:** Amazon achieved its target of matching all electricity consumed by its global operations—including AWS data centers—with 100% renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its original 2030 goal.

- **Global Leadership:** Amazon has been the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for several years, investing billions in more than 600 solar, wind, and nuclear energy projects across 28 countries.
    
- **Impact:** These projects generate enough power to supply the equivalent of over 21.9 million European homes and include significant investments in grid-enhancing technologies and large-scale renewable infrastructure.
    
- **Innovation:** Amazon continues to invest in emerging renewable technologies and supports initiatives like the Climate Pledge Fund to accelerate sustainable innovation.

## **1.9.2 Cloud Efficiency**

- **Energy Efficiency:** AWS infrastructure is up to 4.1 times more energy efficient than typical on-premises data centers, helping customers reduce their workloads’ carbon footprint by up to 99% when compared with traditional IT.
- **Advanced Data Centers:** AWS uses state-of-the-art design, optimized cooling (including free air and liquid cooling), and custom silicon (like Graviton processors) to maximize performance per watt and minimize energy use.
    
- **Resource Optimization:** AWS leverages real-time data, automation, and economies of scale to ensure high utilization rates, further reducing idle capacity and associated carbon emissions.
    
- **Customer Impact:** Migrating workloads to AWS can lower a customer’s carbon footprint by up to 96% when AWS is powered by 100% renewables[](https://sustainabilitymag.com/net-zero/how-aws-makes-data-centres-more-efficient-and-sustainable).

## **1.9.3 Water Stewardship**

- **Water Positive by 2030:** AWS aims to return more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations by 2030. As of 2024, AWS is over halfway to this goal, with a 53% progress rate
- **Efficiency Measures:** AWS minimizes water use through real-time leak detection, advanced cooling technologies, and thousands of sensors that help optimize water usage in data centers.
    
- **Community Projects:** AWS invests in water replenishment projects to expand access, improve water quality, and support local ecosystems in the communities where it operates.
    
- **Global Standards:** AWS aligns its efforts with internationally recognized water stewardship frameworks, such as the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard, which emphasizes sustainable water management at both operational and watershed levels.
