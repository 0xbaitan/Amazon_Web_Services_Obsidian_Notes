- Collection of rich artifacts: video recordings, screenshots, logs, and performance data
    
- Support for standard test frameworks (JUnit, XCTest, Appium, Calabash, etc.)
    
- Real-time remote access to devices for interactive debugging and reproduction of issues
    

**Benefits:**

- **Device diversity:** Test apps on an extensive range of real hardware/OS/device conditions
    
- **Catch bugs before release:** Surface UI, compatibility, and performance problems early
    
- **Faster debugging:** Immediate access to high-fidelity crash reports and logs
    
- **Improved quality:** Ship apps with greater confidence across multiple platforms/versions.
    

**Use Cases:**

- Automated regression and compatibility testing for mobile apps
    
- Manual exploratory app testing on real devices (no local labs required)
    
- Pre-release certification of apps against customer device matrices
    
- Real-world performance validation for global user bases
