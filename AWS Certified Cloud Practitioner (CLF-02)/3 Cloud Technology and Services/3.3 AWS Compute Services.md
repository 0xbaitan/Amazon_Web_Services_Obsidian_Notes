## **Core AWS Compute Services**

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provides secure, resizable compute capacity (virtual machines) in the cloud. EC2 offers a variety of **instance types** optimized for compute, memory, storage, or accelerated computing, supporting a wide range of workloads from web applications to machine learning and high-performance computing.

**AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time consumed, making it ideal for event-driven architectures, real-time file processing, and backend services. ==Charged to the nearest 100ms==

**Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: A fully managed container orchestration service supporting Docker containers, allowing secure and scalable container deployment on AWS-managed infrastructure or on-premises with ECS Anywhere.

**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Provides a managed Kubernetes environment to efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using open-source Kubernetes.

**AWS Fargate**: A serverless compute engine for containers that works with ECS and EKS. With Fargate, you don’t manage servers; you specify and pay for resources per container task, enabling granular cost control and scalability.

**Elastic Beanstalk**: A platform-as-a-service option that simplifies the deployment and scaling of web applications and services. Just upload your application, and Beanstalk handles provisioning, scaling, and health monitoring.

## **Understanding Auto Scaling for Elasticity**

**Auto Scaling** lets you automatically add or remove compute resources based on demand. For EC2, Auto Scaling Groups manage fleets of instances. With containers, ECS/EKS services or Fargate tasks can scale based on load or schedules. Auto scaling helps:

- Maintain performance and availability
- Improve fault tolerance
- Reduce complexity of configuration changes and application deployments with instance refresh
- Optimize cost by running only necessary resources

Use cases include:
- Using previous traffic patterns to determine application scaling in advance of known load changes
- Reduce manual provisioning by following the demand curve of applications
- Use machine learning to predict and schedule the right number of EC2 instances to anticipate approaching traffic changes.
    
---
## **Identifying Purposes of Load Balancers**

**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses), supporting:

- Fault tolerance via spreading traffic across Availability Zones
    
- High availability and seamless failover
    
- Application layer (HTTP/HTTPS) and network layer (TCP/UDP) support
    

Load balancers are essential for decoupling services, handling variable traffic, and ensuring users experience minimal downtime or latency.
