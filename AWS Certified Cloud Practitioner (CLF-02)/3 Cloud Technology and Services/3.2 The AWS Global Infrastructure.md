The **AWS Global Infrastructure** is the backbone of Amazon Web Services, designed to deliver highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable cloud services worldwide. It consists of a globally distributed network of hardware, data centers, and networking components, organized into distinct regions and availability zones.

## **1.7.1 Regions**

- **AWS Regions** are **geographically isolated areas** where AWS clusters data centers spanning geographic locations of North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific, Australia & New Zealand.
    
- Each region is **physically isolated** from other regions, providing independence in terms of **water, energy supply**, and security.
    
- As of July 2025:
    
    - **37 Launched Regions**
        
    - Each region typically contains **3 Availability Zones (AZs)**, though some (like us-east-1) have more.
        
    - The **first AWS Region** was **us-east-1 (North Virginia)**, launched in 2006.
        
- **Regional services** are managed within the scope of a selected region. When using the AWS Management Console, you select the region, and all region-scoped resources are created there by default.

## **1.7.2 Availability Zones (AZs)**

- An **Availability Zone** is a **physically distinct, isolated location** within a region, made up of one or more data centers.
    
- Each AZ has **independent power, cooling, and physical security**, and is connected to other AZs in the same region with **low-latency networking**.
    
- AZs are designed as **fault domains**: a failure in one AZ does not affect others in the same region.
    
- **Best practice**: Deploy workloads across at least **three AZs** for resilience against failures.
    
- **AZ Naming**: Identified by region and letter (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b). You do not select the AZ directly, but rather choose a subnet mapped to a specific AZ.
- **Failure zones**: AZs are physically separated, often in low-risk flood zones, with redundant UPS (uninterruptible power supply).
    
- **You never directly choose an AZ**; you select a subnet, which is mapped to an AZ.

## **1.7.3 Data Centers**

- Each **data center** is a secure, purpose-built facility containing **hundreds of thousands of servers** 
- Data centers within an AZ are close enough for low-latency networking, but far enough apart to reduce risk from localized failures (e.g., flood, power outage).

---

## **1.7.4 Fault Tolerance and Fault Domains**

- **Fault domain**: A segment of the infrastructure susceptible to a single point of failure (e.g., an AZ).
    
- **Fault level**: A collection of fault domains (e.g., a region).
    
- **AZs** act as fault domains, while **regions** are fault levels, ensuring failures are contained and do not propagate.

## **1.7.5 Edge Infrastructure**

- **Points of Presence (PoPs)**: Intermediate data centers for caching and content delivery.
    
    - **Edge Locations**: Used by services like Amazon CloudFront for caching content closer to users.
        
    - **Regional Edge Caches**: Larger caches between edge locations and origin servers.
        
    - **Tier 1 PoPs**: High-capacity, low-latency network hubs.
        
- **Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration**: Uses edge locations to speed up uploads for end users.
    
- **AWS Global Accelerator**: Directs user traffic to optimal endpoints via the AWS global network.

---
## **1.7.6 Direct Connectivity and Local Zones**

- **AWS Direct Connect Locations**: Facilities run by trusted partners, allowing organizations to establish **dedicated network connections** from on-premises environments to AWS.
    
- **Local Zones**: Data centers located close to major metropolitan areas, providing **low-latency access** to AWS services.
    
- **AWS Wavelength Zones**: Designed for **ultra-low latency** applications, integrating AWS compute and storage at the edge of telecommunications providers’ 5G networks.

## **1.7.7 Global and Regional Services**

| Service Type | Scope & Example Services               | Notes                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regional** | EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3 (buckets)         | Managed within a selected region; resources are region-specific. |
| **Global**   | IAM, CloudFront, Route 53, S3 (global) | Operate across all regions; not tied to a single region.         |

- For **CloudFront**, you select a **geographical area** rather than a specific region.

___
## **1.7.8 Data Residency and Compliance**

- **Data residency**: The physical location where data is stored.
    
- **Compliance boundaries**: Legal requirements dictating where data can reside, often enforced by governments.
    
- Tools for compliance and residency:
    
    - **AWS Config**: Tracks resource configurations and changes.
        
    - **AWS Outposts**: Brings AWS infrastructure on-premises for strict residency needs.
        
    - **IAM Policies & Service Control Policies**: Enforce organization-wide controls.
        
- **GovCloud**: AWS regions designed for sensitive data and regulated workloads (e.g., U.S. government).
    
- **FedRAMP**: U.S. government compliance program for cloud services.
    
- **AWS China**: Operates separately; not all services are available, and a business license is required.
