## **Overview: AWS Database Offerings**

AWS offers a complete portfolio of fully managed database solutions across relational, NoSQL, key-value, in-memory, time series, ledger, graph, and migration use cases. Managed databases free you from hardware provisioning, patching, backups, and scaling, letting you focus on application logic, durability, and availability.

- Also available on VMware for hybrid/on-premises deployment.
    

**Amazon Aurora**

- AWS’s flagship high-performance, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible managed database.
    
- Up to 5x faster than standard MySQL and 3x faster than PostgreSQL.
    
- Distributed, self-healing storage that auto-scales up to 128 TB.
    
- Supports Aurora Serverless (on-demand, auto-scaling), Aurora I/O-Optimized (cost-effective for I/O-heavy workloads).
    
- High availability and durability with up to 15 read replicas and cross-AZ replication.
    
- Zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift for real-time analytics.
    
- Fully managed by Amazon RDS.
    

**Amazon Redshift**

- Managed petabyte-scale data warehouse, ideal for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) workloads.
    
- Columnar storage, Massively Parallel Processing (MPP), advanced compression, automatic scaling.
    
- Redshift Spectrum enables running queries on S3 data lakes.
    
- Machine learning-based workload management, robust security, and AWS integration.
    
- Use cases: Real-time analytics (via AWS Data Firehose), business intelligence, large-scale reporting, data lake analytics.

## **Managed NoSQL Databases**

**Amazon DynamoDB**

- Fully managed key-value and document NoSQL service with single-digit ms latency at virtually any scale.
    
- Multi-Region, built-in security, encryption, backup/restore, and in-memory caching.
    
- Handles massive throughput; trusted by enterprises like Lyft, Samsung, and Toyota.
    
- Ideal for IoT, gaming, mobile, ad tech, session stores, and high-velocity use cases.
    

**Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)**

- Managed, scalable, highly available document database for JSON workloads.
    
- Emulates MongoDB APIs—existing drivers work with minimal code changes.
    
- Use cases: Content management, mobile apps, catalogs, and applications needing flexible schema.
    

**Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)**

- Fully managed, serverless, scalable Cassandra-compatible database service.
    
- No server management, automatic scaling, only pay for what you use.
    
- Continuous backup, encryption by default, and enterprise features.
    
- Use cases: IoT, time-series data, large-scale, high-throughput transactional workloads.

## **In-Memory Databases (Caching)**

**Amazon ElastiCache**

- Managed Redis or Memcached for ultra-fast, in-memory caching.
    
- Redis: High availability, scalability, failover, cluster mode, snapshotting.
    
- Memcached: Simple, multi-threaded caching.
    
- Serverless option available; pay-per-use, instant scaling, and 99.99% availability (Four-Nines) SLA .
    
- Use cases: Real-time analytics, gaming, session stores, leaderboard, caching.
    

**Amazon MemoryDB for Redis**

- Fully managed, Redis-compatible, durable in-memory database.
    
- All data remains in memory for ultra-low latency (microseconds to ms) combined with ==Multi-AZ durability==.
    
- Use cases: High-performance primary database for microservices, applications needing both speed and durability.

## **Specialized Databases**

**Amazon Neptune**

- Managed graph database supporting Property Graph (Gremlin) and W3C RDF (SPARQL).
    
- Optimized for billions of relationships, fast queries, and analytics.
    
- Fully managed with point-in-time recovery, cross-AZ replication.
    
- Use cases: Knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendations, network security, drug discovery.
    

**Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)**

- Fully managed immutable ledger database with cryptographically verifiable transaction log.
    
- Designed for use cases requiring a transparent, tamper-evident record of all changes.
    
- Serverless, scales automatically, SQL-like API.
    
- Use cases: Auditable financial transactions, supply chain, data lineage, compliance.
    

**Amazon Timestream**

- Managed, time-series database for IoT and operational applications.
    
- Trillions of events per day, automatic data tiering and retention management.
    
- Serverless, auto-scales, tailored for high-ingest/append-only scenarios.
    
- Use cases: IoT telemetry, DevOps log analytics, sensor data, operational dashboards.

## **Self-Managed (EC2-Hosted) Databases vs. AWS Managed Services**

- **EC2-Hosted Databases:**
    
    - Complete control over OS, database engine and configuration.
        
    - Must handle patching, backups, failover, scaling, monitoring.
        
    - Useful when deep customization, unsupported engines, or legacy migrations needed.
        
- **AWS Managed Databases:**
    
    - Offload undifferentiated heavy lifting to AWS: automated management, HA, scaling.
        
    - Integrated with AWS IAM, CloudWatch, VPC, security features.
        
    - Best for rapid deployment, security, and operational simplicity.

## **Database Migration Tools**

**AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)**

- Migrates data to AWS from on-premises, EC2, or other clouds.
    
- Supports homogeneous and heterogeneous migrations.
    
- Real-time replication and zero-downtime migrations.
    

**AWS SCT (Schema Conversion Tool)**

- Converts database schemas for heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Aurora).
