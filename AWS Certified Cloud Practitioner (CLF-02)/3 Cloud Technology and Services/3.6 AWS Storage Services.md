## **Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)**

- **Object storage** designed for unlimited, unstructured data (files, images, backups, logs, analytics datasets).
    
- **High availability/durability:** ==99.999999999% (11 9’s) across multiple AZs==.
    
- **Use cases:** Backup/restore, DR, archiving, static websites, media storage, big data, IoT, and mobile app data.
    
- **Security:** Fine-grained access control with IAM, bucket policies, and S3 Object Lock for WORM compliance.
    
- **Lifecycle policies:** Automate moving objects between storage classes or deletion for cost optimization.
    
- **Management:** Organize objects in buckets, control access, and monitor usage with wide tooling support (console, CLI, SDKs).

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enable **S3 server access logging**, **AWS CloudTrail logs**, and configure **Amazon CloudWatch alarms** to monitor access, detect suspicious behavior, and audit activity on your S3 buckets. This helps you track who accessed your data, when, and from where for compliance and security.

- **MFA Delete:** Enable **MFA Delete** to require multi-factor authentication for the deletion of S3 objects, providing an additional layer of protection against accidental or unauthorized data removal.

## **S3 Storage Class Differences**

|Storage Class|Description & Use Case|
|---|---|
|**S3 Standard**|Default; frequently accessed data, high durability & availability|
|**S3 Intelligent-Tiering**|Automated cost optimization with tiering for unknown/changing access patterns|
|**S3 Standard-IA**|Lower cost for infrequently accessed data, charges for retrieval|
|**S3 One Zone-IA**|Like Standard-IA but lives in a single AZ; for less critical infrequent access|
|**S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**|Instant access archive (~ms for infrequent, archival access with fast restores)|
|**S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**|Low-cost long-term archive; restore in minutes or hours|
|**S3 Glacier Deep Archive**|Cheapest, for long-term digital preservation; restore in up to 12 hours|
|**S3 Outposts**|Store S3 data on-premises for regulatory/data residency requirements|

`[!!note: S3 lifecycle policies can transition data between classes or enforce retention/delete policies automatically.]`

## **Block Storage (EBS, Instance Store)**

- **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):**
    
    - **Block storage** volumes for EC2, persistent across instance stops/starts.
        
    - Volumes are replicated within an AZ for durability and availability.
        
    - **Use cases:** Boot volumes, databases, transactional workloads, file systems.
        
    - **Performance:** Consistent low-latency; scale up/down dynamically.
        
- **Instance Store:**
    
    - **Ephemeral block storage** physically attached to host, temporary (data lost if EC2 is stopped/terminated).
        
    - **Use cases:** Temporary files, caches, or scratch space for calculations.

## **File Storage (EFS, Amazon FSx)**

- **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):**
    
    - Managed, scalable network file system for Linux workloads (NFS protocol).
        
    - Supports concurrent access from thousands of EC2, container, and on-prem servers.
        
    - **Regional service**: Data is replicated within and across AZs for durability.
        
    - **Use cases:** Big data analytics, web/content management, container storage, dev/test, lift-and-shift for enterprise apps.
        
    - **Storage classes:** Standard (active data), Infrequent Access, Archive (for cold/cost-sensitive data).
        
- **Amazon FSx:**
    
    - Family of managed file systems for Windows, HPC, and enterprise use:
        
        - **FSx for Windows File Server:** SMB protocol, Active Directory, Windows feature compatibility.
            
        - **FSx for Lustre:** Parallel, high-performance for HPC, ML, and media workflows, integrates with S3 for seamless ingest/export.
            
        - **FSx for NetApp ONTAP:** Familiar NetApp features (NFS, SMB, and iSCSI), data management, compression/deduplication, and easy migration for enterprises.
            
        - **FSx for OpenZFS:** Managed OpenZFS (Linux/Unix workloads), rapid deployment, high performance, and native ZFS features.
            
- **Amazon File Cache:** High-speed, fully managed caching service unifying access to dispersed file data (on-prem, across AWS) for high-throughput workloads.

## **Cached File Systems & Hybrid Storage (AWS Storage Gateway)**

- **AWS Storage Gateway:**
    
    - Bridges on-prem environments with cloud storage (NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocols).
        
    - **Types:**
        
        - **File Gateway:** On-prem files presented as S3 objects, with local cache for speed.
            
        - **Tape Gateway:** Replaces tapes with virtual cloud-backed tapes for backup/DR.
            
        - **Volume Gateway:** Cloud-backed iSCSI volumes for on-prem servers — cached and stored modes.
            
    - **Use cases:** Hybrid cloud deployments, backup, disaster recovery, archiving, tiering, supporting both on-prem and AWS workloads.

## **Lifecycle Policies and AWS Backup**

- **Lifecycle Policies:**
    
    - Manage object transitions between S3 storage classes (e.g., move to Glacier after 30/60/90 days) or enforce object deletion for cost controls.
        
- **AWS Backup:**
    
    - **Centralized managed backup service** supporting EC2, EBS, RDS/Aurora, DynamoDB, EFS, FSx, and Storage Gateway volumes.
        
    - Supports multi-account, multi-region data protection using AWS Organizations.
        
    - Policy-based; enables scheduling, retention, compliance, and audit-friendly configuration at scale.
        
    - Cost-effective and automates operational backups (e.g., disaster recovery, compliance, business continuity).
        
- **Elastic Disaster Recovery:** Minimize downtime/data loss for on-prem and cloud workloads with rapid, affordable, point-in-time recovery (uses staging area, monitored for readiness, supports drills/tests).

`[!!warning: If you must replicate to the AWS China Regions or perform replication and recovery into AWS Outposts, use CloudEndure Disaster Recovery available in the AWS Marketplace.]`

## **Key Points for Exam Revision**

- **Object storage (S3):** For unlimited unstructured data, not suitable for OS or databases.
    
- **Block storage (EBS, Instance Store):** Attached like disks to EC2 (EBS = persistent, Instance Store = temporary, high-speed).
    
- **File storage (EFS/FSx):** For shared access use cases—Linux workloads (EFS), Windows/HPC/enterprise (FSx family).
    
- **Storage Gateway:** Best for hybrid on-prem/cloud, migration, or multi-tier backup and DR.
    
- **Backup/Lifecycle:** Know how AWS Backup covers resource types, compliance needs, and how S3 lifecycle policies optimize storage costs.
    
- **Persistent vs. Ephemeral vs. Shared:** Match service persistence, access model, and workload fit.
    

`[!!tip: Be able to quickly map a storage use case or scenario to the most relevant AWS service by access pattern (object vs. file vs. block), persistence, and integration with hybrid/on-premises resources.]`
