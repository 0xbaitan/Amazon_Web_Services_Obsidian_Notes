## **Identifying VPC Components (Subnets, Gateways)**

- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** enables you to create a logically isolated section of AWS where you define your own IP space, create subnets, and configure gateways and route tables. Each VPC is isolated by default, even if IP ranges overlap.
    
- **Subnets**
    
    - Segments of a VPC tied to a single Availability Zone ==(subnets can’t span multiple AZs).==
        
    - **Public Subnet:** Has a route to the Internet Gateway for direct internet access.
        
    - **Private Subnet:** Lacks a route to IGW; used for backend resources not directly accessible from the internet.
        
- **Gateways:**
    
    - **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Needed for resources to have direct internet connections; must be attached to VPC and added to route tables.
        
    - **NAT Gateway/Instance:** Enables private subnets to access the internet for outbound communication (e.g., updates); incoming traffic from the internet is blocked.
        
    - **Virtual Private Gateway (VPG):** Connects your VPC to remote offices via VPN.
        
    - **Customer Gateway:** On-premises device used to connect to AWS over VPN.
        
    - **AWS Transit Gateway:** Hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-prem networks for simplified architecture.

## **Understanding VPC Security (Network ACLs, Security Groups)**

- **Security Groups**
    
    - _Instance-level,_ stateful virtual firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic for each resource.
        
    - Only allow rules exist; return traffic is automatically allowed for approved inbound connections.
        
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)**
    
    - _Subnet-level,_ stateless firewalls.
        
    - Both allow and deny rules (must specify for both inbound/outbound separately).
        
    - Useful for policies affecting an entire subnet, like IP blocks across multiple resources.

## **Understanding Amazon Route 53 (DNS)**

- ==Highly available, scalable DNS web service==.
    
- Resolves domain names to IPs, ELBs, S3 buckets for AWS and external endpoints.
    
- Features include ==DNS health checks, domain registration, and routing methods== (latency/geo/weighted round robin/failover).
    
- Integrates with CloudFront, ELB, S3, and ==supports IPv6==.

## **Identifying Edge Services (CloudFront, Global Accelerator)**

### **Amazon CloudFront**
    
- ==Content Delivery Network for caching and global distribution of content, APIs, videos==.
        
- Integrates with ==S3, EC2, ELB. Supports DDoS mitigation (via AWS Shield), HTTPS, Lambda@Edge== for custom logic at edge.
- Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model, no upfront fees or contracts and support for CDN included in existing Support subscription.
- Can be easily set up in minutes with tools such as APIs, AWS Management Console, AWS CloudFormation, CLIs and SDKs.
        
### **AWS Global Accelerator**
    
 - Improves app performance and availability globally by routing traffic through the AWS global network.
        
- Assigns static IPs for single global entry points and routes users to the closest healthy AWS endpoint.

## **Recognizing Network Connectivity Options (VPN, Direct Connect)**

- **Site-to-Site VPN:** Secure IPSec tunnel over the internet for linking your on-premises network with AWS VPCs; easy to set up but subject to public internet variability.

- **AWS Client VPN**: fully managed, elastic VPN service that enables you to securely connect users, such as remote employees or contractors, to AWS and on-premises networks from anywhere using an OpenVPN-based client. It provides secure, scalable access to resources in AWS (like EC2, RDS, or on-premises servers) without the need to deploy or manage your own VPN hardware or infrastructure.

`[!!note: AWS Client VPN is for remote user/device access to AWS or corp networks, while Site-to-Site VPN connects entire on-premises networks to AWS VPCs.]`

- **AWS Direct Connect:** Dedicated private network (fiber optics) connection for reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth hybrid/workloads. Supports multiple virtual interfaces for access to public and private AWS resources.

## **Supplementary Networking & Discovery Services**

### **API Management & Service Mesh**

- **Amazon API Gateway**
    
    - Fully managed service to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs. Front door for backend services on EC2, Lambda, etc. Handles authorization, monitoring, and scales for hundreds of thousands of concurrent calls.
        
- **AWS App Mesh**
    
    - Provides traffic management, monitoring, and visibility for microservice communications across ECS and EKS using the open-source Envoy proxy.
        

## **Service Discovery**

- **AWS Cloud Map**
    
    - Enables service/resource discovery by dynamically registering and checking cloud resource locations and health, improving application availability and failover.
        
---
## **Private Networking & Connectivity Enhancements**

- **AWS PrivateLink:** Private, secure connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises apps—traffic never traverses the public internet.
    
- **AWS Private 5G & Integrated Private Wireless:** Deploy managed private cellular networks (5G/4G LTE) for secure, low-latency connections for devices and workloads at the edge or in industrial settings. Useful for AR/VR factory automation and autonomous robotics.
    
---
## **Secure Access and Zero Trust Network**

- **AWS Verified Access:** Lets you provide secure, real-time, context-driven access to apps for corporate users without VPN, using ==**AWS Zero Trust principles**==.
    
---
## **Traffic Distribution & Load Balancing**

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Types**
    
    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** HTTP/HTTPS, Layer 7 routing for modern web apps and microservices.
        
    - **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** TCP/UDP, Layer 4 for ultra-high performance and static IPs. Optimised to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.
        
    - **Gateway Load Balancer:** Load balances and scales fleets of network appliances.
        
    - **Classic Load Balancer:** For legacy EC2-Classic deployments (phasing out).

## **Key Revision Tips**

- **Subnets** = Always scoped to a single AZ.
    
- **Security Groups** = Stateful, per instance/resource.
    
- **NACLs** = Stateless, per subnet.
    
- **Route 53** = The core AWS DNS, health checks, global routing.
    
- **CloudFront** = Edge content caching; **Global Accelerator** = Static IP, global traffic acceleration.
    
- **VPN vs. Direct Connect:** VPN is fast to set up but variable; Direct Connect is private, reliable, and scalable for hybrid workloads.
    
- **Transit Gateway** = Aggregates and simplifies multiple VPC/branch/region connections.
    
- **PrivateLink** & **App Mesh** = Secure, scalable private/internal connectivity and service communication.
